## Classroom Experiments Project

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

<p>From Winter 2020 to Summer 2024, I served as Classroom Experiments Manager at <strong>LUISS Guido Carli</strong>, where I managed and coordinated in-class economic experiments for both undergraduate and graduate courses. My role involved experimental design and setup, real-time execution support, and post-experiment data analysis assistance. I primarily utilized <strong>Veconlab</strong> as the main experimental platform, alongside other tools as needed.</p>
