I am a 5th-year PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Innsbruck, currently visiting the University of Chicago. Using field experiments, I investigate how economic incentives and behavioral biases influence decisions in markets that impact sustainability and social welfare.

My dissertation, ***Repair and Reuse Economics***, focuses on two areas: reducing fraudulent behavior among repair service providers and understanding consumer reluctance toward purchasing second-hand goods. I design and implement field interventions to address market failures and behavioral barriers in both sectors.

My broader research agenda includes work on prosocial behavior, exploring the determinants of donations and volunteering, and gender economics, examining how gender shapes economic opportunities and choices.
